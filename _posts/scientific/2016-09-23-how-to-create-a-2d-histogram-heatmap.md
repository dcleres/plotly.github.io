steps:
 - title: Try an Example
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "This 2 dimensional histogram is a great option if you want to compare distributions across two variables."
    - copy: "After selecting '2D Histogram Heatmap' under 'Chart Type', you can check out an example before adding your own data. Clicking the 'try an example' button will show what a sample chart looks like after adding data and playing with the style. You'll also see what values and style attributes were selected for this specific plot, as well as the end result."

    - copy: "You can also use the data featured in this tutorial by clicking on 'Open This Data in Chart Studio' on the left-hand side. It'll open in the workspace."
      img: "![Open data](../static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/open-this-data.png)"

 - title: Add Your Data to Chart Studio
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Head to Chart Studio’s new online [workspace](https://plot.ly/create) and add your data. You have the option of typing directly in the grid, uploading your file, or entering a URL of an online dataset. Chart Studio accepts .xls, .xlsx, or .csv files. For more information on how to enter your data, see [this](http://help.plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/) tutorial."

 - title: Create a Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "After adding your own data, choose your 'Chart Type' in the GRAPH section on the left-hand side and select '2D Histogram Heatmap'."
      img: "![Choose chart main](../static/images/make-a-histogram/chart type 2d hist.png)"
    - copy: "Click on GRAPH on the left-hand side to add your data to your plot. After selecting '2D Histogram Heatmap', you should then fill out the X and Y dropdown to create the plot."
      img: "![Adding axes](../static/images/make-a-histogram/choose values 2d hist.png)"
    - copy: "This will create a raw 2D histogram heatmap, as seen below."
      img: "![Raw plot](../static/images/make-a-histogram/raw 2d hist.png)"

 - title: Style a Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Now it's time to choose the color, text position or typeface. Click on STYLE on the left-hand side to play around with the style of your plot."
    - copy: "To change the colorscale, click on ‘Traces’ under the same STYLE tab, and choose the colorscale you want, with the added option of reversing the colorscale. Note that certain colors and typeface are only available with a PRO subscription. Click [here](https://plot.ly/products/cloud/) to upgrade!"
      img: "![Colour main](../static/images/make-a-histogram/colourscale 2d hist.png)"
    - copy: "This is also where you select the colorscale range, as well as the x and y binning as auto or custom, play with the max bins, and show or hide your color bar."
      img: "![Colour styling](../static/images/make-a-histogram/style 2d hist.gif)"
    - copy: "To add a title to your graph, you can type it directly on the title by double-clicking it. "
      img: "![Type directly title](../static/images/make-a-histogram/type directly 2d hist.png)"
    - copy: "The same can be done for the axis labels and legend."
      img: "![Type directly axes](../static/images/make-a-histogram/axes label 2d hist.png)"
    - copy: "Another option is to visit the 'Layout' section under STYLE, click on 'Title and Fonts' and enter your title in the box, as shown below."
      img: "![Type in layout panel](../static/images/make-a-histogram/title tab 2d hist.png)"

 - title: Save and Share
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Your plot is now done! Click SAVE on the left-hand side."
      img: "![Save main](../static/images/make-a-histogram/save main 2d hist.png)"
    - copy: "Give your PLOT and DATA a filename and select them as 'Public' or 'Private'. For more information on how sharing works, including the difference between private, public, and secret sharing, visit [this](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/) page."
