 - title: Intro to the View Plot
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "When you [save](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/#step-1-save-your-plot) and [embed](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/#step-5-share-your-plot) your plot, the shareable link directs you to your shareplot viewer."
      img: "![Shareable link](../static/images/how-sharing-works-in-plotly/shareable link.png)"
    - copy: "The View Plot page is where you'll view not only the plot, but its data, code, and sources."
      img: "![Shareplot main](../static/images/how-sharing-works-in-plotly/Main Shareplot Page.png)"
    - copy: "Clicking the 'Data' tab will show the plot's data. The entire dataset may not be displayed if it's too large, but rest assured that the entire grid has been saved. The ellipses appear when this is the case."
      img: "![Shareplot data](../static/images/how-sharing-works-in-plotly/shareplot data.png)"
    - copy: "The 'Code' tab will display the plot's code, JSON being the default programming language. Select from the dropdown menu on the right-hand side to see the others, including Python, Matlab and R."
      img: "![Shareplot code](../static/images/how-sharing-works-in-plotly/Shareplot Code.gif)"
    - copy: "'Sources' tracks how data is shared between Chart Studio users for audit control. How does this work? When you click on 'Fork & Edit' on another Chart Studio user's chart, a new node is created in the 'Sources' tree. The example below is a plot created by Wired author Rhett Allain. It's been forked many times by other Chart Studio users."

    - copy: "How can you get to the View Plot page if you don't have the shareable link handy? Keep reading to find out!"

 - title: From Your Organize
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "The ['Organize'](https://plot.ly/organize/home) page is also known as your 'list of files'. This is where your saved plots and grids are kept."
      img: "![Organize homepage](../static/images/how-sharing-works-in-plotly/organize homepage.png)"
    - copy: "Hover over the thumbnail of the plot you'd like to view and click 'View'."
      img: "![Thumbnail hover](../static/images/how-sharing-works-in-plotly/thumb hover.png)"
    - copy: "It'll direct you to the View Plot page, and you'll see the associated data, code, and sources of that plot. If you select to view a grid (instead of a plot), you'll only be able to see its data and sources."

 - title: From Your Workspace
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Another way to get to your View Plot page is through Chart Studioâ€™s online [workspace](https://plot.ly/create)."
    - copy: "Click on your username on the top right-hand side and choose either 'My Files' or 'Profile' from the pop-up list."
      img: "![Workspace dropdown](../static/images/how-sharing-works-in-plotly/workspace dropdown.png)"
    - copy: "Both 'My Files' and 'Profile' pages are very similar, in the sense that you can see all the plots and grids that you've saved, but only *you* can view your 'Organize' page."
    - copy: "From either of these pages, you can follow the same steps as above. Just hover over the thumbnail of your choice and click on 'View'."
    - copy: "The animated image below shows how we navigate from the workspace to the 'My Profile' page, and then to the View Plot page."
      img: "![Shareplot my profile](../static/images/how-sharing-works-in-plotly/shareplot my profile.gif)"

 - title: From Your Feed
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "The [Chart Studio feed](https://plot.ly/) is featured on Chart Studio's homepage. You can click on 'My Files' to access your 'Organize' page, or click on your username to select from the same dropdown menu as seen in the workspace."
      img: "![Chart Studio Homepage](../static/images/how-sharing-works-in-plotly/plotlyfeed.png)"
    - copy: "This is also where users' plots are displayed for the public to see. These plots have saved as 'Public'."
    - copy: "Hover over the plot you'd like to check out and click on 'View'. It'll direct you to the View Plot page."
