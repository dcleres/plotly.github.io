Keeping track of your data source is important. That's why Chart Studio automatically includes a link to the URL that hosts your data. | <img src="/static/images/getting-data/data-source-url.png">

You can also sync Chart Studio graphs with [externally sourced data](http://chriddyp.github.io/external-source-plotter/). These graphs can be shared by a URL or embedded in a webpage, and whenever a user views the graph, Chart Studio fetches the latest data from your web service. Use the [external source plotter](http://chriddyp.github.io/external-source-plotter/) when you don't want to send your user to Chart Studio's Web App. We have examples documented for SQLite, Flask, Quandl, Google Drive, GitHub Gists, and Dropbox.


<h1><a href="https://www.data.gov/meta/open-apps/">Data.gov</a></h1>


<p>Data.gov is the home of the U.S. Government's open data and hosts over 124,651 data sets. They've recently built an "Open With" option that let's you send the data directly to Chart Studio to create interactive graphs for free. This feature is supported on smaller CSV and XLS files. Look for the "Open With" menu when searching through their data sets.</p>

<h1><a href="http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/tutorial.html">WebPlotDigitizer</a></h1>

[WebPlotDigitizer](http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/) lets you automatically grab data from an image and export the data directly to Chart Studio. With Chart Studio you can recreate an interactive version of the graph, easily stylize your work, and even analyze the data.

Let’s say, for example, you’re reading this [Mother Jones article](http://www.motherjones.com/blue-marble/2013/12/signal-increasing-hurricane-intensity-finally-emerging-noise) on the rising strength of hurricanes. The source of this data is an academic paper we don’t have access to, but WebPlotDigitizer can grab the data and send it Chart Studio.

The first step is to save a copy of the image (or take a screen shot). Then open [WebPlotDigitizer's App](http://arohatgi.info/WebPlotDigitizer/app). Click on **File**, and then **Load Image**. Upload your saved image. | ![Upload data to WebPlotDigitizer](/static/images/getting-data/upload-file-to-webplotdigitizer.png)
We select the plot type (in this case "2D (X-Y) Plot") and click on **Align Axes**. WebPlotDigitizer gives simple instructions to select four points to align the axes.<br><br>This particular graph has an $x$-axis with value labels but no tick marks. To be as precise as possible, we can mouse over a known value, such as the data peak at 1983. Any time you mouse over your WPD graph, the panel in the upper right corner zooms in and displays coordinates as $[x,y]$. Once we find the appropriate $x$-coordinate (in this case 73.78), we can move our mouse to the $x$-axis to select the first point.<br><br>We use the same method for the other three points. Click **Complete!** once you've selected four points.| ![Align axes by selecting points](/static/images/getting-data/align-axes-by-selecting-points.png)
We now enter the point values we selected for the points selected on the $x$ and $y$ axes. Because this graph has years on the $x$-axis, we use the format "yyyy/mm/dd". Click **Okay**. | ![Label selected points on axes](/static/images/getting-data/label-selected-points-on-axes.png)
We'll use the default manual mode, and add a point by clicking on each peak and valley on the line that defines the graph. Once this is complete, we click on **View Data** to open the extracted data set. | ![Manually select peaks and valleys](/static/images/getting-data/manually-select-peaks-and-valleys.png)
Click on the **Graph in Chart Studio** button to recreate the graph. Once the graph loads, you can click on **VIEW DATA** to see the underlying data. | ![Click on graph in Chart Studio to export the data](/static/images/getting-data/click-on-graph-in-plotly-to-export-the-data.png)

<h1><a href="http://blog.import.io/post/plotly-integration">import.io</a></h1>

Import.io is a great service to help you scrape data automatically from webpages. To utilize the Chart Studio export, you'll need to head over to [import.io](https://import.io) and set up a free account.

[Ikea](http://www.ikea.com/ca) (in Canada) has [77 table lamps for sale](http://www.ikea.com/ca/en/catalog/categories/departments/living_room/10732/) on their webpage. Let's say you are interested in the average price of their offerings, or perhaps would like to make a histogram of the prices. Instead of manually extracting the data, we can use import.io.

Open [import.io](https://import.io/), and sign in. Enter the URL of the page with the data you want to extract. Click on **Try it Out**. | ![Enter URL at import.io](/static/images/getting-data/enter-url-at-import-io.png)
You'll see the data appear in spreadsheet form. Look for the pink **Get API** button in the lower right. Click it. | ![Use get API button to extract data](/static/images/getting-data/use-get-api-button-to-extract-data.png)
Click on the **Copy this to My Data** button in the box that appears, and you'll see the data in a form where we can select columns to extract. Click the Plot.ly button above the data. | ![Click Plot.ly to extract](/static/images/getting-data/click-plot-ly-to-extract.png)
We can check the columns of data what we wish to extract to Chart Studio. Here we choose "producttitle_value" and "price_value_prices". Finally, click on the blue **Export to Plot.ly** button. | ![Select columns to export](/static/images/getting-data/select-columns-to-export.png)

The data will open in a Chart Studio grid, where you can analyze and graph the data. You might like to check out our tutorials on [basic statistics](/basic-statistics-mean-median-standard-deviation) and [histograms](/make-a-histogram) to get some ideas.
