      img: "![Single data column](/static/images/histogram-with-excel/image05.png)"
    - copy: "These values will appear on our x-axis.  The heights of the bars of our histogram will denote how many times each value or 'bin' of values appears in the column. To learn more see: [histogram](https://plot.ly/histogram/)"
