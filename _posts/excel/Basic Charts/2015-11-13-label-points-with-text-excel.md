 - title: Creating Your Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Once you've loaded the data in Plotly, select 'Scatter plot' from the MAKE A PLOT menu. Look for the 'text' option in the sidebar. This will enable you to select columns that associate text with corresponding data points. For each group of data that you want to plot, you'll need to select a column of x-values, a column of y-values, and a column for the text labels. When you're finished, click on the blue 'Scatter plot' button in the sidebar."

    - copy: "To add text labels, open the 'Traces' popover by selecting TRACES from the toolbar. You can add labels to an individual trace by selecting that trace from the dropdown menu, or select 'All traces (scatter)' to label all the points in your scatter plot. Here we position the labels on individual traces in order to avoid overlapping labels. We start with Col1. In the 'Mode' tab, look for 'Lines/Markers' and select the option of text over a point."

    - copy: "Repeat this process for Col4 and Col7. For Col4, we position the text labels below the scatter points. For Col7, we position them above the scatter points."
