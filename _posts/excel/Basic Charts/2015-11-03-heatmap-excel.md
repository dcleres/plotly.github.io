 - title: Head to Chart Studio
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Head to [Chart Studio](https://plot.ly/plot) and sign into your free Chart Studio account. Go to 'Import', click 'Upload a file', then choose your Excel file to upload. Your Excel file will now open in Chart Studio. For more about Chart Studio, see [this tutorial](/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/)"
      img: "![Import button](https://images.plot.ly/excel/heat-map/import-data-heat-map.png)"
    - copy: "Select 'Heatmaps' from the MAKE A PLOT menu."
      img: "![Dropdown](/static/images/heat-map-with-excel/image06.png)"
    - copy: "Select the 'Column names' button from the X-AXIS options in the sidebar and click 'Select all columns' button."
      img: "![Select all columns](/static/images/heat-map-with-excel/image10.png)"
    - copy: "Deselect any columns you don't want to plot, and your row names column if you have one. This will be your 'y' value."

   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Your plot should look something like this."
      img: "![Unstyled heatmap](/static/images/heat-map-with-excel/image00.png)"
    - copy: "The first step to styling it into the heatmap above is to open the TRACES popover in the toolbar."
      img: "![Style menu](/static/images/heat-map-with-excel/image12.png)"
    - copy: "This is what the 'Style' tab of the TRACES popover should look like. We've selected one of the default gradients, red-yellow-blue."
      img: "![Gradient colors](/static/images/heat-map-with-excel/image14.png)"
    - copy: "For this particular data, we also want to center our gradient so that yellow correlates to a value of 60.2, and everything above or below is a little red or green. The easiest way to do this is by nudging the 'Z range' values in the 'Range/bins' tab to converge on our desired midpoint  -- we compressed our range, but you can also stretch it if you prefer the effect."
      img: "![Setting the range](/static/images/heat-map-with-excel/image03.png)"
    - copy: "(Alternative: if you want to make a contour plot, just change the 'Type' setting in the 'Mode' tab.)"

    - copy: "Here's how the LAYOUT popover should look."
      img: "![Adjusting the background color](/static/images/heat-map-with-excel/image11.png)"

    - copy: "We've titled our chart, and used markup to format our text and source our data."
