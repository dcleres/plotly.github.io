steps:
 - title: Introduction
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Chart Studio dashboards are a stunning way to display and share your graphs. Your charts are fully interactive with publication-quality graphics, and there's nothing to download or install â€” it's 100% web-based."
    - copy: "Our dashboards are used by companies such as Netflix, Tesla, and Google for their customization options and features. If you too want to present your plots in a cool way, keep reading."
    - copy: "For this tutorial we've taken screenshots from our dashboard, which can be found [here](https://plot.ly/~plotly2_demo/237/untitled-dashboard/)."

 - title: Create a Dashboard
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Go to https://plot.ly/dashboard/create/. You can also get there from your [Organize page](https://plot.ly/organize/) and clicking on the blue '+ New' button, then selecting 'Dashboard'."

    - copy: "The image below is what an empty dashboard looks like. As you can see, you have a few options of what to add, including a plot, text or a webpage."

 - title: Add a Plot
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "To add a chart to your dashboard click on 'Plot'."
      img: "![Add plot](../static/images/dashboards/add plot window.png)"
    - copy: "Another window will be displayed, and you'll have the option of adding it by entering the URL of the plot, or uploading it from your list of files."
      img: "![Add plot window](../static/images/dashboards/add plot window.png)"
    - copy: "If you choose 'URL', it's the Shareable Link that's provided when you [share](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/#step-5-share-your-plot) your plot."
      img: "![Add URL](../static/images/dashboards/add url.png)"
    - copy: "Clicking on 'Your Files' will open a popup that will display your saved plots. These are plots that are in your [Organize](https://plot.ly/organize/)."
      img: "![Your files](../static/images/dashboards/Your Files.png)"
    - copy: "After adding your first plot, you can continue to add more plots or start styling the dashboard."
      img: "![Plot added](../static/images/dashboards/first plot.png)"

 - title: Add Additional Plots
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "To add a second plot, we'll click on the 'Plot' button as the bottom left side of the page."
      img: "![Add second plot](../static/images/dashboards/second plot.png)"
    - copy: "It'll open another 'Add a Plot' window below your first chart, so you may have to scroll down to view it. Note that we've zoomed out for the purpose of this tutorial."

 - title: Style Your Dashboard

      img: "![Titles](../static/images/dashboards/plot title.png)"
    - copy: "You can also add a title for the entire dashboard by clicking on 'Settings'. It's important to note that the URL of your dashboard reflects this dashboard title upon the first save. If you want your URL to have the same name as your header, save your dashboard only after you've added this title."
      img: "![Settings](../static/images/dashboards/dashboard settings.png)"
    - copy: "This will open a panel to the right, which is also the general area where we'll style our dashboard."
      img: "![Settings panel](../static/images/dashboards/dashboard settings panel.png)"
    - copy: "Type your title directly in the field under 'Title'. As you type, you'll notice it being added to the dashboard header bar."
      img: "![Dashboard title](../static/images/dashboards/Add dashboard title.gif)"

      img: "![Add logo](../static/images/dashboards/logo.png)"

Click [here](http://help.plot.ly/dashboard-privacy/) to learn more about dashboard privacy. For more information on how sharing works, including the difference between private, public, and secret sharing, visit [this](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/) page."

 - title: Tips and Tricks
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "We mentioned selecting the privacy setting for your dashboard, but don't forget to check the privacy settings for the individual plots in your dashboard as well. You may need to change the setting of each plot in order for others to view your entire dashboard."

 - title: Python API
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "If you're familiar with python, you can utilise the python API to [create dashboards programmatically](https://plot.ly/python/create-online-dashboard/). If you're looking more to create reactive web applications in pure python, try [Dash](https://plot.ly/dash)"
