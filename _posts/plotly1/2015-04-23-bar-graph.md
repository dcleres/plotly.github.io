### Step 1A: Set up the grid (two traces)

If you’re trying to make a bar chart like the one above, which compares two different sets of numbers in the same categories, you have options getting started.
The first option is to arrange these two data sets into two different columns.

This is one way you could set up Plotly’s grid to make the graph above (You can copy data from [here](https://plot.ly/~cimar/191)). | ![Zoo data for bar chart](/static/images/bar-graph/zoo-data-for-bar-chart.png)
Select **Bar chart** from the **MAKE A PLOT** menu. | ![Choose an option from the MAKE A PLOT menu](/static/images/bar-graph/plot-menu.png)
Click the blue plot button in the sidebar to create the chart.  (Need more help with the grid? Check out our tutorial ["How to Enter Data in the Grid"](https://plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid) ) | ![Add data to Plotly Grid](/static/images/bar-graph/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid.png)

### Step 1b: Set-up the grid (Group by)

Your second option is to have a column of variables identifying which dataset each row belongs to, and then “grouping by” this column.

This is another way you could Plotly’s grid to make the graph above (You can copy data from [here](https://plot.ly/~mariahh/3096) ). | ![Alternative graphing option](/static/images/bar-graph/alternative-graphing-option.png)
Select **Bar chart** from the **MAKE A PLOT** menu.  |  ![Select bar chart from MAKE A PLOT menu](/static/images/bar-graph/select-bar-chart-from-make-a-plot-menu.png)
Select **Group by** from the **OPTIONS** in the sidebar, and select choose as G from the Zoo column. | ![Select Group By from the Options menu](/static/images/bar-graph/select-group-by-from-options-menu.png) ![Choose G from Zoo column](/static/images/bar-graph/choose-g-from-zoo-column.png)
Click the blue plot button in the sidebar to create the chart.  (For more help with the grid see: [Add data to the Plotly Grid](https://plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid) ) | ![Add data to Plotly Grid](/static/images/bar-graph/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid.png)

### Step 2: Setting the Traces

Your plot should look something like this.  The first step to styling it into the horizontal bar graph above is to open the **TRACES** popover in the toolbar. | ![Vertical bar chart](/static/images/bar-graph/vertical-bar-chart.png) ![Traces popover](/static/images/bar-graph/traces-popover.png)
Select **All Traces (bar)** from the drop down menu. Click on **Flip bars &amp; Axis config** to make your bar chart horizontal. | ![All traces in drop down menu](/static/images/bar-graph/all-traces-in-drop-down-menu.png) ![Flip Bars and Axis config](/static/images/bar-graph/flip-bars-axis-config.png)
(Alternative: if you want to stack or overlay your bars, instead of grouping them, just change the **Mode** setting.) | ![Style menu Mode setting](/static/images/bar-graph/style-mode-setting.png) ![Stacked  bar chart online](/static/images/bar-graph/stacked-bar-chart.png)

### Step 3: Style it!

Now your plot should look something like this: a grouped horizontal bar chart. We still have some styling to do to get the plot at the top of this tutorial! Open **TRACES** again. | ![Grouped horizontal bar chart](/static/images/bar-graph/grouped-horizontal-bar-chart.png)
This is how the **Style** tab of the **TRACES** popover on **LA Zoo** should look. We’ve altered every option in this panel: Opacity, Bar Gap, Group Gap, Fill, and Border. | ![Style tab of Traces popover LA Zoo](/static/images/bar-graph/style-tab-of-traces-popover-la.png)
This is how the **Style** tab of the **TRACES** popover on **SF Zoo** should look. These are the same as for **LA Zoo**, but fill and border are different colors. | ![Style tab of Traces popover SF Zoo](/static/images/bar-graph/style-tab-of-traces-popover-sf.png)
This is how the **LAYOUT** popover should look. We’re changing the font throughout the plot.  We’re also giving the plot a grey background, and nudging the margins. | ![Change the background color in the layout menu.](/static/images/bar-graph/layout-popover-general.png) ![Layout popover Margins](/static/images/bar-graph/layout-popover-margins.png.png)
This is how the **AXES** popover should look.  We’re giving the plot thicker white gridlines. | ![Change the style of grid lines in the axes popover.](/static/images/bar-graph/axes-popover.png)
This is how the **LEGEND** popover should look, we’re giving it a grey background, and moving the position. | ![Style the legent using the Legend menu](/static/images/bar-graph/legend-popover.png)

Your finished chart should look something like this. | ![Finished bar chart](/static/images/bar-graph/finished-bar-chart.png)
