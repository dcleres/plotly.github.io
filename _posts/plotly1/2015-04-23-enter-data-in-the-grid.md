# How to Enter Data in the Grid

### Step 1: Set up the Grid

The first step to making any Chart Studio graph is setting up the data in a grid.
You can type your data directly into a grid, or copy it from a spreadsheet and paste it in.


Open a **+ NEW GRID** from the file well. | ![New grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/new-grid.png)

Type directly into the cells, or type &#8220;ctrl-v&#8221; to paste in clipboard content. | ![Type or paste content](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/type-or-paste-content.png)

Click the **Save** icon and give it a name, then choose your **Sharing Settings** or just click **Close**. It will be saved to your **Workspace** under **My files** for future plots and to share it. | ![Name and save grid](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/name-and-save-grid.png) !New grid in workplace](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/new-grid-in-workplace.png)

You can import .csv, .xls, or .xlsx files directly into Plotly. Additionally, you can import data from Google Drive and Dropbox.

Upload a file using the **IMPORT** tab. | ![Import from Google Drive](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/import-from-google-drive.png) ![File upload](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/file-upload.png)
If you upload a workbook, a new grid will be created for every sheet within the book&#8230; | ![New sheets in workspace](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/new-sheets-in-workspace.png)
&#8230;they’re all stored in a folder named after your file in the filewell. | ![Filewell](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/filewell.png)

**View Data**
You can extract the data from any Chart Studio graph, and build your own graph out of it!

Go to any graph page. The one pictured to the right is [https://plot.ly/~slkent/51](https://plot.ly/~slkent/51). Click the **DATA** button, located in the lefthand sidebar, to view the data. To load the data in your workspace, click on **Fork and edit**. | ![Fork and edit](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/view-data-fork-and-edit.png)
Click the **VIEW DATA** button, located in the toolbar, to view the data. | ![View data](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/get-data.png)
&#8230;the column names should let you know what role they played in the original plot. | ![Column names](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/column-names.png)
Save and name your new data set and save it to the filewell, to have it on-hand for future plots and to share it. | ![Save data to filewell](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/save-data.png)

### Step 2: Plot

Once your grid is set up, you’re ready to plot!

Select your plot type from the **MAKE A PLOT** menu. | ![Select plot type](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/select-plot-type.png)
Click the **OPTIONS** you’d like to enable in the sidebar&#8230; | ![Enable options in sidebar](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/enable-options.png)
&#8230;then set your variables with the buttons that have appeared below the column headers&#8230; | ![Set variables](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/set-variables.png)
&#8230;different colors indicate different data sets. These will be plotted as different colors by default. | ![Different colors for different data sets](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/different-colors.png)
Click the **PLOT** button at the bottom of the sidebar to make your plot. You can either make a new plot (default) or add to an existing one. | ![Click plot button](/static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/click-plot-button.png)
