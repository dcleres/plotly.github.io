Plotly's surface plots are interactive. Click and drag to rotate, scroll to zoom, hover over the graph to see values.

### Step 1 - Enter or upload your data into a plotly grid

Visit the [workspace](https://plot.ly/plot) to enter data. A 3D surface plot graphs data 3D dimensional data: the height at each (x, y) point is given by that point's (z) value. Enter your 3D surface data as a matrix into the spreadsheet.
