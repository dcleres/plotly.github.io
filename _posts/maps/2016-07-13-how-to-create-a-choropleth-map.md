 - title: Try an Example
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "A choropleth map provides an easy way to visualize how a measurement varies across a geographic area or it shows the level of variability within a region."
    - copy: "After selecting 'Choropleth' under 'Chart Type', you can check out an example before adding your own data. Clicking the 'try an example' button will show what a sample chart looks like after adding data and playing with the style. You'll also see what locations, values, and style attributes were selected for this specific map, as well as the end result."

 - title: Add Your Data to Plotly
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Head to Chart Studio’s new online [workspace](https://plot.ly/create) and add your data. You have the option of typing directly in the grid, uploading your file, or entering a URL of an online dataset. Plotly accepts .xls, .xlsx, or .csv files. For more information on how to enter your data, see [this](http://help.plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/) tutorial."

The 'Location Format' field includes country names, country ISO-3 codes, and US state names. Since our map has USA data, we'll select USA under the 'Location Format' and 'Map Region' fields. These sections are selected depending on your data."
      img: "![Values dropdown](../static/images/choropleth-map-with-excel/choropleth-values.png)"
    - copy: "This will create a raw choropleth map as seen below."
