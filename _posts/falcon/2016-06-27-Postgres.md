    - copy: "NOTE: If you are running your database locally, the *host* input field can stay empty since its default value is 'localhost'. Similarly, if your database is setup on port number *3306*, you may leave the *port* input field empty as well. If your database is setup on a remote server, simply copy the endpoint name into the *host* input field and enter the remote server's port number on which your database is located."
