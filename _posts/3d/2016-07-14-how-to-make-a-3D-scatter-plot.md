steps:
 - title: Try an Example
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "A 3D scatterplot graphs the data values of three variables against each other on the x, y, and z axes."
    - copy: "After selecting '3D Scatter' under 'Chart Type', you can check out an example before adding your own data. Clicking the 'try an example' button will show what a sample chart looks like after adding data and playing with the style. You'll also see what values and style attributes were selected for this specific plot, as well as the end result."

    - copy: "You can also use the data featured in this tutorial by clicking on 'Open This Data in Plotly' on the left-hand side. It'll open in your workspace."
      img: "![Open data](../static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/open-this-data.png)"

 - title: Add Your Data to Plotly
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Head to Chart Studio’s new online [workspace](https://plot.ly/create) and add your data. You have the option of typing directly in the grid, uploading your file, or entering a URL of an online dataset. Plotly accepts .xls, .xlsx, or .csv files. For more information on how to enter your data, see [this](http://help.plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/) tutorial."

 - title: Create a Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "After adding your own data, go to GRAPH on the left-hand side, then 'Create'. Choose '3D Scatter' under 'Chart type'."
      img: "![Choose chart main](../static/images/scatter-plot-3D/3D-scatter-chart-type.png)"
    - copy: "Click on GRAPH on the left-hand side to add your values to your graph. After selecting ‘3D Scatter', you should then fill out the X, Y, and Z dropdowns to create the plot."
      img: "![Values dropdown](../static/images/scatter-plot-3D/3D-scatter-XYZ-values.png)"
    - copy: "This will create a raw 3D scatter plot as seen below."
      img: "![Raw plot](../static/images/scatter-plot-3D/3D-scatter-raw.png)"

 - title: Style a Chart
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "You can choose your color, text position, or typeface. Click on STYLE on the left-hand side to play around with the style of your plot."
    - copy: "To change the color of the points, click on ‘Traces’ under the same STYLE tab, and choose the color you want. Additionally, this section allows you to change the diameter of the points and also the symbol. Note that certain colors and typeface are only available with a PRO subscription. Click [here](https://plot.ly/products/cloud/) to upgrade!"
      img: "![Colour main](../static/images/scatter-plot-3D/3D-scatter-colour-panel.png)"
    - copy: "To add a title to your graph, you can type it directly on the title by double-clicking it. The same can be done for the legend."
      img: "![Type directly title](../static/images/scatter-plot-3D/3D-scatter-type-title.png)"
    - copy: "Another option is to visit the 'Layout' section under STYLE, click on 'Text' and enter your title in the box, as shown below."
      img: "![Type in layout panel](../static/images/scatter-plot-3D/3D-Scatter-title-panel.png)"
    - copy: "For adding axes labels, the 'Text' box is found in the 'Axes' section under STYLE. Note that you have to click on each X, Y, and Z text box to add its own label."

 - title: Save and Share
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Your plot is now done! Click SAVE on the left-hand side."
      img: "![Save main](../static/images/scatter-plot-3D/new scatter save main.png)"
    - copy: "Give your file a name, then select your PLOT and DATA as 'Public' or 'Private'. For more information on how sharing works, including the difference between private, public and secret sharing, visit [this](http://help.plot.ly/save-share-and-export-in-plotly/) page."
