# Adding New Tutorials

In the plotly.github.io repo, tutorials are written as individual .md files. These files are organized into sub-folders (by subject) inside the [`/_post`]( https://github.com/plotly/plotly.github.io/tree/master/_posts) folder.

To create a new tutorial, generate a new `.md` file in the appropriate folder for the tutorial (i.e. if the tutorial is 'Box-plots in Chart Studio' add your `.md` file to the [statistical folder](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.github.io/tree/master/_posts/statistical)).
Ensure that the title of the `.md` file includes the date (date created): `yyyy-mm-dd-title-of-tutorial.md`. Thus:

```
/_posts/statistical/
---2018-07-26-how-to-create-a-box-plot.md
```

## Front Matter
These are the variables defined at the top of each post:

- layout: `tutorial-single_layout` or additional options listed [here](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.github.io/tree/master/_layouts)
- title:
- subtitle:
- meta_desription: `A tutorial on how to --insert tutorial subject-- --insert Plotly Tool (i.e. in Chart Studio)--`.
- tags: `fundamentals` | `basic` | `statistical` | `scientific` | `maps` | `graph3d` | `layout` | `subplot` | `textandlinks` | `analysis`
  Determines which section to place the tutorial in: http://help.plot.ly/tutorials/. This variable is used in [the templates](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.github.io/blob/master/_layouts/tutorials.html#L58)
- permalink: the link added to http://help.plot.ly/
- imageurl: path to thumbnail image (thumbnail displayed on help.plot.ly/tutorials)
- state: `active` | `inactive` (if active, will appear on table of contents page).
- order: determines the order displayed in the given section on help.plot.ly/tutorials. Can be a float or int.
- actioncall:
- actioncall-url: link to tutorial plot in the workspace
- live-graph: iframe embed of tutorial plot
- otherlang: Know how to program? See how to create this in [Python](https://plot.ly/python/applicable-python-doc/) or [R](https://plot.ly/r/applicable-r-doc/).

For example, here is the front matter for the boxplot tutorial:
```
layout: tutorial-single_layout
title: Box Plots in Plotly 2.0
subtitle: A convenient way of graphically depicting groups of numerical data through their quartiles.
meta_description: A tutorial on how to make a box plot in Plotly 2.0.
permalink: /make-a-box-plot/
imageurl: ../static/images/how-to-make-a-boxplot/thum-how-to-make-a-boxplot.png
state: active
tags: statistical
order: 2.5
actioncall: How to Make a Box Plot in Plotly 2.0
actioncall-url: https://plot.ly/alpha/workspace/?fid=plotly2_demo:108
live-graph: <iframe width="900" height="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://plot.ly/~plotly2_demo/108.embed"></iframe>
otherlang: Know how to program? See how to create this in [Python](https://plot.ly/python/box-plots/) or [R](https://plot.ly/r/box-plots/).
```

## Content
Content is placed immediately under the front matter in `steps`. Here, content is divided into sections with `- title` and `sub-steps`. Depending the tutorial you're writing, try to remain consistent with the sub-step layout. For example, for a chart tutorial you would use something like:

- Try an example
- Add Your Data to Chart Studio
- Create Your Chart
- Style Your Chart
- Save and Share

Within each sub-step you can use `- copy` to define the text and `img` for the images / screenshots. It is important to note that text and images must exist inside quotations. Furthermore, use alt tags in images `img: "![Add Trace](../static/images/box-plot/add-trace.png)"`.

Here is a snippet of the content for the boxplot tutorial:

```
steps:
 - title: Try an Example
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Box plots may have lines extending vertically from the boxes, or whiskers, indicating variability outside the upper and lower quartiles. This type of plot is also known as a box-and-whisker plot or box-and-whisker diagram."
    - copy: "After selecting 'Box plot' under 'Chart Type', you can check out an example before adding your own data. Clicking the 'try an example' button will show what a sample chart looks like after adding data and playing with the style. You'll also see what values and style attributes were selected for this specific chart, as well as the end result."
      img: "![Example after](../static/images/box-plot/try-an-example.png)"
    - copy: "You can also use the data featured in this tutorial by clicking on 'Open This Data in Chart Studio' on the left-hand side. It'll open in your workspace."
      img: "![Open data](../static/images/enter-data-in-the-grid/open-this-data.png)"

 - title: Add Your Data to Chart Studio
   sub-steps:
    - copy: "Head to Chart Studioâ€™s new online [workspace](https://plot.ly/create/box-plot/) and add your data. You have the option of typing directly in the grid, uploading your file, or entering a URL of an online dataset. Chart Studio accepts .xls, .xlsx, or .csv files. For more information on how to enter your data, see [this](http://help.plot.ly/add-data-to-the-plotly-grid/) tutorial."
      img: "![Import data main](../static/images/box-plot/import-data.png)"
```

## Images

Where possible add images (screenshots) and gifs to tutorials to supplement instruction text. For each tutorial create a folder in `/static/images/<chart-tutorial-name>` i.e. `/static/images/box-plot`. Here, add each image with a descriptive filename (up to 5 or 6 words) such as `static/images/box-plot/add-trace.png` instead of something generic like  `static/images/box-plot/img1.png`. An example of an images folder would be:

```
/static/images/box-plot/
---add-trace.png
---color-trace.png
---style-plot-background.png
---add-annotations.png
```

## Make a PR

Ready for your changes to be reviewed? Make a pull request against `master`!
